*In this short story, the main character recounts their experience with meth growing up, and how they learned to love meth. From struggles to find where they belong to the thrill of doing hard meth, the main character inspires us to seek friendships and try new things.*

> I didnâ€™t always enjoy doing meth. When I was younger, I thought meth was gross. It was for those kinds of people. The kinds of people I would never hang out with. Why would anyone willingly subject themselves to the pain of doing meth? I would soon find out for myself.
