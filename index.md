# Fun With Meth

I didn't always enjoy doing meth. When I was younger, I thought meth was gross. It was for *those* kinds of people. The kinds of people I would never hang out with. Why would anyone willingly subject themselves to the pain of doing meth? I would soon find out for myself.

**This is my story.**

It all started in middle school. After years of anti-meth conditioning from books, TV, and the media, my opinion on meth was that it was painful, only done by crazy people, and I would never enjoy doing it. The one place that didn't have any of that? The internet.

I was probably only 11 or 12 years old when I discovered a thriving community of meth users on the internet. They were all so passionate about doing meth and wanted to share the thrill with the world. Because of the stigma surrounding the topic, it wasn't always mainstream, but for those in the know, there wasn't anything like this out there. The meth was always presented cleanly by people who you could tell were captivated by the meth.

I thought to myself, "Wow. If these people could have so much fun doing meth, maybe I can do meth too!" Slowly, I was warming up to the idea of doing meth. I still didn't think I was old enough, and it still felt out of reach, especially the hard stuff. I didn't know if I could handle it. I lurked in the meth community, savoring every conversation, every video, every post. I didn't tell anyone about my discovery for fear of backlash. I didn't want to be known as "that kid" at school.

Fast forward a couple of years, and I was entering high school. I heard some rumors that there were plenty of people who did meth at my school, so I was excited to find out. I tried to do meth at home, using resources I found online, but I wasn't very good at it and gave up. I thought that maybe if I could find local meth users, I could get some help doing meth.

One day, I decided to hang around after school to see if anyone was doing meth. This was the best decision of my life. In one of the classrooms was a group of kids doing meth with two adults. The other kids called them the "Meth Lords". They welcomed me in, and while I was nervous at first, I warmed up enough to ask them what they were doing. The meth they were doing looked like the hard stuff, and they were doing it so quickly too! I told them that I wanted to do meth but didn't feel like I was "worthy" enough to do so and was intimidated. They very generously broke down the meth into smaller chunks and walked me through doing it step by step. They even let me take some home! I was so happy!

That night, I stayed up to do meth. The thrill was unbelievable. All the things I took for granted before finally made sense. The world felt wide open. I didn't get much sleep that night.

The next day, I tried doing some more meth. This time, however, was different. It took me longer to finish, and I even started to get a little frustrated. My body wasn't able to handle it, so I gave up and went to bed. After school the next day, I found one of the Meth Lords who just told me to keep trying. Which is what I did. The thrill when finally finishing was incredible. I had never experienced anything like that before. I was truly addicted.

From that moment on, my life revolved around meth. I saw meth everywhere. I began to appreciate the meth that people did to bring us the world. I tried to dabble in a little bit of chemistry to see if I could do more meth there, but the chemistry kids told me that they didn't actually do that much meth. If I wanted hard meth, I'd have to do physics.

I quickly learned that physics was not for me, and while I appreciated all the hard meth they were doing, it didn't have that same thrill. I enjoyed doing meth just to do meth. Sometimes, it would be useful, but that wasn't what I was seeking. To this day, I continue to do meth, even if I only do some of the lighter stuff, saving the hard stuff for weekends or special occasions. It brings me joy to see younger generations doing meth and having fun too!

Meth connects us all, from the universe to each other. It's something we share across cultures, a tool we use to explore. I've always had fun with meth. I hope you do as well.
