I 😀 didn't always enjoy doing meth. When I 😀 was younger, 🧒 I 😀😀😀 thought 💭 meth was gross. 🤢 It was for _those_ kinds of people. 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦👨‍👨‍👦‍👦 The 🤘 kinds of people 👭 I 😀 would never hang out 😵 with. Why would anyone willingly subject themselves to the 🤘 pain of doing meth? I 😀😀😀 would soon 🔜 find 🔍 out 😵 for 🈺 myself.

**This is my 😊 story.**

<hr>

It all started 🆕 in middle 🖕 school. 🚸 After years of anti-meth conditioning from 😤 books, 📗📕 TV, and the 🤣 media, my 😀 opinion on meth was that it was painful, only done ⏳ by crazy 🤪🤪🤪 people, 👨‍👧‍👧👯 and I 😀 would never enjoy doing it. The 🤘 one 🔞 place 🛐 that didn't have 🈶 any of that? The 🤘 internet. 📶

I 😀 was probably only 11 or 12 years old 👨‍🦳 when I 😀 discovered a thriving community of meth users 🗣️ on the 🤣 internet. 🌐🌐🌐 They 👩‍👩‍👦‍👦 were all so 🆘 passionate about doing meth and wanted to share the 🤘 thrill with the 🤣🤣🤣 world. 🌐 Because of the 🤘 stigma surrounding the 🤣 topic, it wasn't always mainstream, but 😥 for 🔰 those in the 🤣 know, there wasn't anything like 👭 this out 😵 there. The 🤘🤘🤘 meth was always presented 🎁 cleanly by people 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 who you 😀 could tell 🗣 were captivated by the 🤘 meth.

I 😊 thought 💭 to myself, "Wow. ❕ If these people 👩‍👩‍👦‍👦 could have 🈶 so 🆘 much fun 💃🕺 doing meth, maybe I 😊 can do meth too!" Slowly, I 😀 was warming ♨️ up to the 🤘 idea 💡 of doing meth. I 😀 still 🧍‍♂️🧍‍♂️🧍‍♂️ didn't think 🤔💭 I 😀 was old 🗝️🔘👩‍🦳🗝️🔘👩‍🦳🗝️🔘👩‍🦳 enough, and it still 🧍‍♀️ felt out 😵 of reach, especially the 🤣 hard stuff. 🧸🧸🧸 I 😊 didn't know if I 😀 could handle 🍵 it. I 😊 lurked in the 🤣 meth community, savoring 😋 every conversation, every video, 🎮🎮🎮 every post. 🏤 I 😀 didn't tell 🗣 anyone about my 😊 discovery for 🔰 fear 😱 of backlash. I 😀 didn't want to be known as "that kid" at school. 🚸

Fast 🏍️ forward 🔼 a couple 💒👭💒👭💒👭 of years, and I 😀 was entering ↩️ high ⚡ school. 🚸 I 😊 heard 🇭🇲 some rumors that there were plenty of people 👩‍👩‍👧‍👦👩‍👦‍👦 who did meth at my 😀 school, 🚸 so 🆘 I 😊 was excited to find 🔍 out. 😵 I 😀 tried to do meth at home, 👨‍👩‍👧 using resources I 😊😊😊 found online, but 😥 I 😊 wasn't very good 🦸‍♂️ at it and gave up. I 😀 thought 💭 that maybe if I 😊 could find 🔍 local meth users, 🗣️ I 😊 could get 🉐 some help 🆘 doing meth.

One 🕐🩱🔞 day, I 😊 decided to hang around after school ✏️ to see 🙈 if anyone was doing meth. This was the 🤣 best decision of my 😊 life. 🧬 In one 🩱🔞 of the 🤘 classrooms 📔 was a group 👥 of kids doing meth with two 🐫 adults. The 🤘 other kids called 🤙 them the 🤣 "Meth Lords". 👑 They 💁 welcomed me in, and while I 😀 was nervous 😥 at first, 🌓🥇 I 😀 warmed ♨️ up enough to ask them what 😦 they 💁 were doing. The 🤣 meth they 👩‍👩‍👦‍👦 were doing looked 👁️ like 💙 the 🤣 hard stuff, 🥙 and they 💁 were doing it so 🆘 quickly too! I 😊 told them that I 😀 wanted to do meth but 😥😥😥 didn't feel like 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩💌👨‍❤️‍💋‍👨💑💙 I 😊 was "worthy" enough to do so 🆘🆘🆘 and was intimidated. They 💁 very generously broke down ⏬ the 🤣 meth into smaller 🤏◽ chunks and walked me through doing it step 🚶‍♂️ by step. 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️ They 💁 even 🌝 let me take some home! 👨‍👦 I 😊 was so 🆘 happy! 😺

That night, 🌑 I 😊 stayed up to do meth. The 🤣 thrill was unbelievable. All the 🤣 things I 😀 took for 🈺 granted before finally made sense. The 🤣 world 🌏🗺️ felt wide open. 👐 I 😊 didn't get 🉐 much sleep 🌒 that night. 🌘

The 🤘 next ➡️ day, I 😀 tried doing some more ➕➕➕ meth. This time, 🕠🕒🕘🕚 however, was different. It took me longer 🪘 to finish, and I 😊 even 🌘 started 🆕 to get 🉐 a little frustrated. 🙄🙄🙄 My 😀 body wasn't able to handle 🍵 it, so 🆘 I 😀 gave up and went to bed. 🛏️ After school ✏️ the 🤣 next ⏭️⏭️⏭️ day, I 😊 found one 🕜 of the 🤘 Meth Lords 👑 who just told me to keep trying. Which is what 😦 I 😊 did. The 🤘 thrill when finally finishing was incredible. I 😀 had never experienced anything like 👬 that before. I 😀 was truly addicted.

From 😤 that moment on, my 😊 life 🧬 revolved around meth. I 😊 saw 🪚 meth everywhere. I 😊 began to appreciate the 🤘 meth that people 👨‍👩‍👧 did to bring us the 🤣 world. 🌐 I 😀 tried to dabble in a little bit of chemistry ⚗️ to see 🙈 if I 😊😊😊 could do more ➕ meth there, but 😥 the 🤘 chemistry 🧑‍🔬🧪⚗️ kids told me that they 👩‍👩‍👦‍👦 didn't actually do that much meth. If I 😀 wanted hard meth, I'd have 🈶 to do physics. ⚛️

I 😀 quickly learned 📘 that physics ⚛️ was not ⏳⏳⏳ for 🔰 me, and while I 😀 appreciated all the 🤘 hard meth they 💁 were doing, it didn't have 🈶 that same thrill. I 😀 enjoyed doing meth just to do meth. Sometimes, it would be useful, but 😥 that wasn't what 😦 I 😊 was seeking. 👀👁️ To this day, I 😊 continue ⏩ to do meth, even 🌗 if I 😊 only do some of the 🤘 lighter 🚥 stuff, 🥙 saving 🔖 the 🤘 hard stuff 🧸🧸🧸 for 🈺 weekends or special occasions. It brings me joy 😆😋😀 to see 👁️ younger 🧒 generations doing meth and having 🈶 fun 🕺🕺🕺 too!

Meth connects us all, from 😤 the 🤣 universe to each other. It's something we 👩‍👩‍👦‍👦 share across cultures, 🏛️🏛️🏛️ a tool 🪛 we 🌿 use to explore. I've always had fun 💃 with meth. I 😊 hope 🙏🙏🙏 you 😊😀 do as well.
